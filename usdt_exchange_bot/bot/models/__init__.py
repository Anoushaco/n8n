# You might need a single Base for all models if you plan to create tables using a single metadata instance.
# For now, each model has its own Base. This can be refactored later.

# Example for a single Base approach (optional refactor):
# from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
# Base = declarative_base()
# from .user import User
# from .order import Order
# from .transaction import Transaction
# ... and then ensure User, Order, Transaction inherit from this shared Base.
